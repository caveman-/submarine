# submarine
This is an approach on building a low cost autonomous submarine. It's started as a project at [ComSys, RWTH Aachen](https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/home/).
It is especially noteworthy that we do not have very high expertise regarding the construction of electrical components.
Thus, this is not a thorough manual but just experience we gathered from our own work. 
Nevertheless, we want to encourage you to contribute and share your own experience.
